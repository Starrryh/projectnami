# Project nami
To save our planet, we try to make an idea for saving ocean health.

There are countless entrances to Ocean Pollution, and there is only one exit.
To save our planet, we try to make an idea for saving ocean health.

# Why we do
The purpose is to detect ocean pollution. It is key to know whether the current recycling system is appropriately working. If a relatively large amount of plastic is found in a particular area on an ongoing basis, the recycling system in that area may be reviewed. This is the first step toward decreasing ocean plastics and maintaining ocean health.

# What we do
Make an application that detects, visualizes, tracks and forecasts ocean plastic amounts. There are methods to detect objects on the ground however, it is very challenging to detect the ocean one.

# Architecture
Input: Using NASA's open-source API to get their data.

ML model: To decide and detect which one is ocean debris and another one is not.

Output: Build Power BI to visualize amount of ocean plastics.


# Bussiness impact
Project Goal: Protect Ocean environment 

How: Use satellite data and create ML model to detect Ocean Plastics and to help protect ocean environment.

End user: Government that try to protect ocean, Tourist industry, Fishing industry

Code name: nami … means "wave" in Japanese

Selling points: There have been methods to detect something from satellite data on the ground, but it is challenging to detect objects floating in the ocean (Predictable things that the target of UN SDGs goal 14 moves forward to reduce CO2, ground garbage and ocean plastics).
